Version History
===============

version 0.8
==================================
- TODO
- Developers note the signature change of
  `CRM_Banking_PluginModel_PostProcessor::shouldExecute` (and thus overriding
   methods in Postprocessor implementations) to include a new boolean parameter
   `$preview` denoting whether the method is being called during Postprocessor
   preview or not. The method might have to be respond differently, since e.g.
   no contributions have been processed at the preview stage.
